 A Lemmy API Client built with Dart. Continuation of the original [Lemmy Dart API](https://github.com/LemmurOrg/lemmy_api_client) and [Liftoff Dart API](https://github.com/liftoff-app/lemmy_api_client).

 Updates are done at a best-effort basis to ensure compatibility with the current major version of Lemmy. Due to the unstable nature of Lemmy API, there will be limited support for the last major version.
 
 **Notice**: While efforts are made to keep as much parity as possible with the Lemmy API, it is not guaranteed. If a particular endpoint or feature is missing, feel free to create a feature request or a pull request implementing that endpoint.
